# Red-Brick-Warehouse
A tiny codebase which stores every single idea that I learnt from courses, or come up myself, include but not limited to data structures, algorithm and programming abstraction that seems to be fun and interesting to implement myself. Certainly, this package is not the best tool for production projects and by convention nobody shouldn't reinvent the wheels themselves when there's already sufficient tools that provides those features, but I still decide to write everything to give myself a more concrete understanding of the topics learnt. Feel free to look around this codebase to see if there's anything that interest you or could potentially be helpful for you own mini project or learning. I will update relevant details and explanations of everything in the codebase, thank you very much.
